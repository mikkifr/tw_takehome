This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Technical decisions/FYI
- Created backend endpoints for bulk fetching of data (ideally calls to third-party APIs would be cached)
- Used Grafana UI which caused issues with SSR, so components are client side (SWR adds a bonus refresh) 
- Couldn't find reliable Grafana UI docs on how to pull cell values for use with link generation (e.g. __value.raw), so use Grid view to access company detail pages
- Couldn't find clear examples on responsive Grafana charts so used magic numbers here and there (also made responsive UI difficult implement)

## Getting Started
First ensure a premium Alpha Vantage API key is in your local .env file (provided in project submission), e.g. `ALPHA_API_KEY=XXXXXXX` 

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
